</p>
<p>
    Last Updated: July 21, 2013
</p>
<p>
    Aggregus, LLC. (“Aggregus”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
    disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.Aggregus.com (the “Site”) and any related applications (the “Application”) and otherwise,
    through the Service. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service. This Privacy Policy may be updated from
    time to time. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by
    email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your Aggregus Account) or by means of a notice via the Service prior to the change becoming effective. We
    encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms
    used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (at www.Aggregus.com).
</p>
<p>
    As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or
    other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using,
    combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
</p>
<p>
    International Transfer
</p>
<p>
    YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO - AND MAINTAINED ON - COMPUTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION
    WHERE THE PRIVACY LAWS MAY NOT BE AS PROTECTIVE AS THOSE IN YOUR JURISDICTION. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CHOOSE TO PROVIDE
    INFORMATION TO US, AGGREGUS TRANSFERS PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROCESSES IT THERE. YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY FOLLOWED BY
    YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION REPRESENTS YOUR AGREEMENT TO THAT TRANSFER.
</p>
<p>
    Information Collection and Use
</p>
<p>
    Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content (collectively, the “Service”),
    to administer your use of the Service and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Service.
</p>
<p>
    Personally Identifiable Information
</p>
<p>
    When you register with us through the Service and become a Member and when you choose to post a Listing or book an Experience, or when you wish to contact
    another Member, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you
    (“Identity Information”). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address, social security number (SSN), and
    home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. In order to process some of your transactions through the
    Service, we may also ask for your credit card number and other billing information (“Billing Information”) (Identity Information and Billing Information
    together, “Personal Information”). If the address associated with a Listing you post matches that of your credit card billing address, that address would
    be considered Identity Information. Some Personal Information may be required, like your name and email address, and other Personal Information may be
    optional, like your date of birth. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.
</p>
<p>
    We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join the Service. You can register to join via the Service by completing the
    required forms.
</p>
<p>
    You may also be permitted to register to join by logging into online accounts you may have with third party service providers (“SNS”) (e.g. Facebook); each
    such account, a “Third Party Account”, via the Service as described below. As part of the functionality of the Service, you may link your Aggregus Account
    with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Aggregus through the Service; or (ii) allowing Aggregus
    to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You
    represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Aggregus and/or grant Aggregus access to your Third Party Account
    (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use
    of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Aggregus to pay any fees or making Aggregus subject to any usage limitations imposed by the
    applicable SNS. If you decide to register by logging into a Third Party Account via the Service, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided
    to the applicable SNS (such as your “real” name, email address, profile picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS groups to which you belong, other
    information you make publicly available via the applicable SNS and/or other information you authorize Aggregus to access by authorizing the SNS to provide
    such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your Aggregus Account and Aggregus Account profile page and you will
    become a Member. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you
    understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the SNS and
    authorized by you) the information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your Aggregus Account on the Service. If there is
    information about your “friends” or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those “friends” or
    people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable SNS.
</p>
<p>
    We may also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Aggregus Account
    profile (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) (“Non-Identifying Information”).
</p>
<p>
    We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your
    transactions, and administer your inquiries.
</p>
<p>
    Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,
    combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered
    Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your demographic information).
    We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Aggregus Users (defined
    below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how the Service is
    used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your
    preferences or restrictions.
</p>
<p>
    We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Aggregus newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of
    interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
    provided in any of the communications or contact us as detailed in the “Changing or Deleting Information” section, below. Please note that we may also use
    your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications.
</p>
<p>
    Log Data
</p>
<p>
    When you visit the Service, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Aggregus User”), our servers automatically record
    information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet
    Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Service, pages of the Service that you visit, the time spent
    on those pages, information you search for on the Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use
    of the Service and for the Service’s technical administration, to increase the Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the
    Service to our visitors' and users’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to and users of the Service meet the criteria required to
    process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate,
    analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information. Cookies Like many websites, we use
    “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Our cookies help
    provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your
    browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all
    cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. Third party advertisers on the Service may also place or read
    cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from
    the websites you visit. We may also use Flash cookies, which operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web
    browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit adobe.com and make changes at the privacy settings panel.
    If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service.
</p>
<p>
    Web Beacons
</p>
<p>
    Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs), which would be used along with cookies to
    compile aggregated statistics to analyze how the Service is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been
    opened by recipients. This would allow us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>
    Sending Messages Via a Aggregus Account
</p>
<p>
    As part of the Service, Aggregus Users may communicate with Aggregus Members through the Service. Where Aggregus Users have selected the option of adding
    one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template may be sent from Aggregus to those email addresses on
    their behalf. If so, such email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee.
</p>
<p>
    Phishing
</p>
<p>
    Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Aggregus. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity
    theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Aggregus Account ID, login password, or national
    identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade
    Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov.
</p>
<p>
    Information Sharing and Disclosure
</p>
<p>
    Overview
</p>
<p>
    The Service can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of Experiences. Listings for such Experiences are made available via the Service by Hosts.
    Listings posted by Hosts, ratings and reviews of Members, and the Profile Information (as defined below) of Members, are visible to any Aggregus User.
</p>
<p>
    Aggregus Members and Users
</p>
<p>
    When you create a Aggregus Account, we will set up a Aggregus Account profile page for you. Your Aggregus Account profile page will include your first name
    and last initial. You can select the other items of Personal Information that you wish to be included in your Aggregus Account profile page – including,
    but not limited to, a profile picture. We will display your Profile Information in your Aggregus Account profile page publicly via the Service, and, with
    your prior permission, on third party sites. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile Information will be publicly visible to all
    Aggregus Users and consequently should reflect how much you want other Aggregus Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and
    sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can
    review and revise your Profile Information at any time.
</p>
<p>
    Listings
</p>
<p>
    If you post a Listing, we may publish that Listing publicly via the Service and may enable third parties to publish your Listing on their websites through
    the use of an HTML “widget”. We may also display the geographical location of your Listing in the form of a map so that potential Guests can see the
    general area and neighborhood of your Listing, but the actual street address will not be disclosed until you enter into a confirmed transaction with
    another Member. If you request to make a booking via the Service, Aggregus may share the following information about you with the applicable Host: your
    first and last name and a link to your Aggregus Account profile page. All of this information will enable the Host to decide whether to confirm or reject
    your booking. When a Host confirms a booking we may share pieces of the Host’s Identify Information, including, but not limited to, full name, phone
    number, the Experience’s starting address and the Host’s email address, with the applicable Guest selected by the Host and we may share pieces of the
    Guest’s Identify Information with the Host, including, but not limited to, full name, phone number and email address, so that the Guest and Host may
    contact one another directly. In no event is a Guest's Billing Information shared with a Host.
</p>
<p>
    Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information
</p>
<p>
    We may share aggregated information that does not identify you personally and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third
    parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not identify you
    personally.
</p>
<p>
    Service Providers
</p>
<p>
    We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site and
    Application-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, fraud detection services relating to the
    activity of Aggregus Users and improvement of the Service's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties may have
    access to your Personal Information; if they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are obligated not to
    disclose or use it for any other purpose. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications. Third party vendors, like Google, may use cookies
    to serve ads based on a Aggregus User's prior visits to Aggregus. You can disable these specific cookies that track prior visits for the sake of follow-up
    advertising by opting out at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.

    claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Aggregus or a third party, to protect the safety
    of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable
    activity.

    We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials and to our insurance services providers as we, in our sole
    discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to protect the property and rights of Aggregus or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any
    person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

    Changing or Deleting Your Information

<p>
    All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us at support@Aggregus.com or

</p>
<p>
    Security
</p>
<p>
    Aggregus takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
    alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the
    Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when
    disclosing any Personal Information to Aggregus via the Internet.
</p>
<p>
    Links to Other Websites
</p>
<p>
    Our Site and Application may contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of
    advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a
    banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an
    endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may
    place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules
    regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other
    websites you visit.

    The Service is not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or
    guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us. If we become
