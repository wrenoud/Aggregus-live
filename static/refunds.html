<h1>
    Guest Refund Policy Terms
</h1>
<p>
    Last Updated: July 21, 2013
</p>
<p>
    These terms and conditions govern the Aggregus Guest Refund Policy (the “Guest Refund Policy”) available to Guests who book and pay for an Experience
    listed by a Host through the Aggregus platform (the “Site”) and suffer a Situational Conflict and the obligations of the Host associated with the Guest
    Refund Policy.
</p>
<p>
    1. Situational Conflict. A “Situational Conflict” means any one of the following:
</p>
<p>
    a) The Host of the Experience (i) cancels a reservation within 24 hours before the scheduled start of the reservation, (ii) fails to arrive for the
    Experience within 20 minutes of the scheduled start time, or (iii) fails to provide the Guest with the reasonable ability to access the Experience (e.g.,
    by allowing the Guest access to the space in which the Experience will happen or begin if applicable).
</p>
<p>
    b) The description of the Experience in the listing on the Site is materially inaccurate with respect to (i) the duration of the Experience, (ii) the
    content of the Experience (including but not limited to the stated activities or sites, as applicable), or (iii) the physical location of the Experience.
    c) During the Guest’s Experience, conditions do not meet safety or health hazards that would be reasonably expected, given the nature of the particular
    Experience, in Aggregus’s judgment.
</p>
<p>
    2. The Guest Refund Policy. If you are a Guest and suffer a Situational Conflict, we agree, at our discretion, to either (i) reimburse you up to the amount
    paid by you through the Site, as determined by Aggregus in our discretion, depending on the nature of the Situational Conflict suffered or (ii) use our
    reasonable efforts to find and book you another Experience which in our determination is reasonably comparable to the Experience described in your original
    reservation in terms of content and quality. For clarity, in the event the alternative Experience is of a higher price than the former, you may be
    responsible for any difference in price. In the event the alternative Experience is of a lower price, you may be entitled to a partial refund for the
    difference. All determinations of Aggregus with respect to the Guest Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund, shall be final and
    binding on the Guests and Hosts.
</p>
<p>
    3. Conditions to Claim a Situational Conflict. Only a Guest may submit a claim for a Situational Conflict. If you are a Guest, in order to submit a valid
    claim for a Situational Conflict and receive the benefits with respect to your reservation, you are required to meet each of the following conditions:
</p>
<p>
    a) You must report the Situational Conflict to Aggregus in writing (at support@Aggregus.com) or via telephone and provide us with information (including
    evidence) about the Experience and the circumstances of the Situational Conflict within 24 hours after the start of your reservation, and must respond to
    any requests by us for additional information or cooperation on the Situational Conflict;
</p>
<p>
    b) You must not have directly or indirectly caused the Situational Conflict (through your action, omission or negligence); and
</p>
<p>
    c) You must have used reasonable efforts to try to remedy the circumstances of the Situational Conflict with the Host prior to making a claim for a
    Situational Conflict (and you must provide evidence of having done so).
</p>
<p>
    4. Minimum Quality Standards, Host Responsibilities and Reimbursement to Guest. If you are a Host, you are responsible for ensuring that the Experiences
    you list on the Site meet minimum quality standards regarding adequacy of the description on the Site, safety, health, and do not present a Guest with
    Situational Conflicts. Throughout the Experience, Hosts should be available in order to try, in good faith, to resolve Guest issues.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a Host, and if (i) Aggregus determines that a Guest has suffered a Situational Conflict related to an Experience listed by you and (ii) Aggregus
    either reimburses that Guest any amount up to the amount paid by the Guest through the Site for the Experience or provides an alternative Experience to the
    Guest, you agree to reimburse Aggregus up to the amount paid by Aggregus within 30 days of Aggregus’s request. All determinations of Aggregus with respect
    to the Guest Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund to the Guest, shall be final and binding on the Guests and Hosts. You also
    agree that in order for you to reimburse Aggregus up to the amount paid by Aggregus, Aggregus may off-set or reduce any amounts owed by Aggregus to you by
    this amount. If the Guest is rescheduled to an alternative Experience, you may lose part or all of the Experience Fee payment for the booking and you may
    be responsible for reasonable additional costs incurred to reschedule the Guest to the alternative Experience.
</p>
<p>
    The rights of the Guests under the Guest Refund Policy supersede the cancellation policy that otherwise applies to a particular Experience. If you dispute
    the Situational Conflict you may notify us in writing (support@Aggregus.com) or via telephone and provide us with information (including evidence)
    disputing the claims regarding the Situational Conflict, provided you must have used reasonable and good faith efforts to try to remedy the Situational
    Conflict with the Guest prior to disputing the Situational Conflict claim (and you must provide evidence of having done so). You agree that all
    determinations of Aggregus with respect to the Situational Conflict shall be final and binding on the Guests and Hosts regardless of your submission of a
    dispute against such Situational Conflict. In the event of one or more
</p>
<p>
    Situational Conflicts, Aggregus, in its discretion, may elect to take additional actions. These actions include, but are not limited to, negatively
    affecting your listing ranking, automated reviews or notifications indicating Situational Conflicts, canceling future bookings, suspending or removing the
    listing of the Experience or imposing penalties or fees for the administrative burden associated with the Situational Conflicts.
</p>
<p>
    5. General Provisions.
</p>
<p>
    a) No Assignment/No Insurance. This Guest Refund Policy is not intended to constitute an offer to insure, does not constitute insurance or an insurance
    contract, does not take the place of insurance obtained or obtainable by the Guest, and the Guest has not paid any premium in respect of the Guest Refund
    Policy. The benefits provided under this Guest Refund Policy are not assignable or transferable by you.
</p>
<p>
    b) Modification or Termination. Aggregus reserves the right to modify or terminate this Guest Refund Policy, at any time, in its sole discretion, and
    without prior notice.
</p>
<p>
    c) If Aggregus modifies this Guest Refund Policy, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification and Aggregus
    will continue to process all claims for Situational Conflicts made prior to the effective date of the modification.
</p>
<p>
    d) Entire Agreement and Definitions. This Guest Refund Policy constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Aggregus and you
    regarding the Guest Refund Policy and supersedes and replaces any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Aggregus and you
    regarding the Guest Refund Policy. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Aggregus Terms of Service.
    Controlling Law. This Guest Refund Policy will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America,
    without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.
</p>
<p>
    e) Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL AGGREGUS’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGGREGUS POLICY TERMS, EXCEED THE
    AMOUNT OF THE EXPERIENCE FEES COLLECTED BY AGGREGUS FROM THE GUEST. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
    CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY POSTING A LISTING OR BOOKING AN
    EXPERIENCE OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE, SERVICES AS A HOST OR GUEST, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND
    BY THESE POLICY TERMS.
