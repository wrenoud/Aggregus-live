</p>
<p>
    Modification
</p>
<p>
    Aggregus reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the Services at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post
    the modification on the Site or via the Services or provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the “Last Updated Date” at the top of
    these Terms. Any changes will become effective immediately upon your acceptance of the modified Terms, whether by, without limitation, creating a Listing
    or requesting the booking of an Experience. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.
</p>
<p>
    Eligibility
</p>
<p>
    The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. Any access to or use of the Services by anyone under 13 is expressly prohibited. By
    accessing or using the Services you represent and warrant that you are 13 or older.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How the Site, Application and Services Work</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Services can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of tours and activities (“Experiences”). Such Experiences are included in Listings on the
    Services by Hosts. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Services; however, if you wish to book an Experience or create a Listing, you
    must first register to create an Aggregus Account (defined below).
</p>
<p>
    As stated above, Aggregus makes available a platform or marketplace with related technology for Guests and Hosts to meet online and arrange for bookings of
    Experiences. Aggregus is not an operator of tours, activities or other Experiences, nor is it a provider of tours, activities or other Experiences and
    Aggregus does not own, sell, resell, furnish, provide, manage and/or control any transportation, tour or travel services. Aggregus’s responsibilities are
    limited to: (i) facilitating the availability of the Services and (ii) serving as the limited agent of each Host for the purpose of accepting payments from
    Guests on behalf of the Host.
</p>
<p>
    PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE THE BOOKING OF EXPERIENCES. AGGREGUS CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE
    CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY EXPERIENCES. AGGREGUS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
    LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND EXPERIENCES. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE AT THE GUEST’S OWN RISK.
</p>
<p>
    Account Registration
</p>
<p>
    In order to access certain features of the Services, and to book an Experience or create a Listing, you must register to create an account (“Aggregus
    Account”) and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as otherwise described in this section.
</p>
<p>
    You may also be able to register to join by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited
    to, Facebook); each such account, a “Third Party Account”, via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Services,
    you may be able to link your Aggregus Account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Aggregus
    through the Services; or (ii) allowing Aggregus to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern
    your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Aggregus and/or grant
    Aggregus access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the
    terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Aggregus to pay any fees or making Aggregus subject
    to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. By granting Aggregus access to any Third Party Accounts, you understand that
    Aggregus may access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third Party Account (“SNS Content”)
    so that it is available on and through the Services via your Aggregus Account and Aggregus Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms,
    all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and
    subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party
    Accounts may be available on and through your Aggregus Account on the Services. Please note that if a Third Party Account or associated service becomes
    unavailable or Aggregus’s access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content may no longer be available
    on and through the Services. You have the ability to configure certain portions of the connection between your Aggregus Account and your Third Party
    Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Profile” section of the Services. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS
    ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Aggregus makes no effort to
    review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Aggregus is not responsible for any
    SNS Content.
</p>
<p>
    We will create your Aggregus Account and your Aggregus Account profile page for your use of the Services based upon the personal information you provide to
    us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Aggregus Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and
    complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Aggregus reserves the right
    to suspend or terminate your Aggregus Account and your access to the Services if you create more than one (1) Aggregus Account or if any information
    provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your
    password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions
    under your Aggregus Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Aggregus of any unauthorized use of
    your Aggregus Account.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Experience Listings</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As a Member, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Experience to be listed, including, but not limited
    to, the location, capacity, itinerary, features, availability of the Experience and pricing and related rules and financial terms. Listings will be made
    publicly available via the Services. Other Members will be able to book your Experience via the Services based upon the information provided in your
    Listing. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Experience, the price for such booking may not be altered.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and
    the booking of, or Guest taking of, an Experience in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties
    (such as any agreements with or rules of employers or local tourism agencies) and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax
    requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Experience included in a Listing you post, including, but not limited to, tourism, tour Host
    licensing laws, and other laws governing events and tours of public spaces and other venues and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please
    note that Aggregus assumes no responsibility for a Hosts’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. Aggregus reserves the right, at any
    time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Aggregus, in its sole discretion,
    considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Services.
</p>
<p>
    You understand and agree that Aggregus does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as a Host. If a Guest requests a booking of your
    Experience and participates in your Experience, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Aggregus is not a party
    thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Aggregus serves as the limited authorized agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on
    behalf of the Host and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Host, subject to these Terms. When you create a Listing, you may also choose to
    include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Experience. Any Member wishing to book
    Experiences included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a Host, Aggregus may make certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for
    booking for your Experience. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for
    the acts and omissions of any individuals who are present during the Experience at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the
    Guest invites to the Experience, if applicable.) Aggregus recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Experiences. Please review any
    insurance policy that you may have for your Experience carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any
    exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will
    cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Experience, if applicable) while participating in your Experience.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>No Endorsement</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregus does not endorse any Members or any Experiences. In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not
    attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member’s purported identity. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you
    contact via the Services. We will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.
</p>
<p>
    By using the Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third
    parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose
    liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Aggregus with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with
    other Members via the Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against Aggregus
    regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Aggregus on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in
    the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.
</p>
<p>
    Bookings and Financial Terms
</p>
<p>
    <u>Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts</u>
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Experience via the Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within the
    specified timeframe (which is generally within 24-48 hours of when the booking is requested, as determined by Aggregus in its sole discretion) or the
    booking request will be automatically cancelled. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of an Experience within the specified
    timeframe, any amounts collected by Aggregus for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest’s credit card and any pre-authorization of
    such credit card will be released.
</p>
<p>
    When a booking is requested via the Services, we may share with you the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking and a link to the
    Guest’s Aggregus Account profile page.
</p>
<p>
    The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Experience Fees (defined below) and the Guest Fees (defined below). Where applicable, Taxes may be
    charged in addition to the Experience Fees and Guest Fees. The Experience Fees, the Guest Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these
    Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and payable by a Guest solely relating to a Host’s Experience are the “Experience Fees”. Please note that it is
    the Host and not Aggregus which determines the Experience Fees. Aggregus charges a fee to Guests of five percent (5%) of applicable Experience Fees which
    are the “Guest Fees”. The Guest Fees are added to the Experience Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in
    the applicable Listing. Aggregus will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Host confirms the booking within the
    specified timeframe) and will initiate payment of the Experience Fees (less Aggregus’s Host Fees (defined below)) to the Host within 24 hours of when the
    Guest arrives at the applicable Experience (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest). However, please note that we will not be responsible
    for delays in remitting Experience Fees, which can vary based on the bank, currency, location, etc.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Appointment of Aggregus as Payment Agent for Host</u>
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    Each Host hereby appoints Aggregus as the Host’s limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Guests on behalf of the Host. Each
    Host agrees that payment made by a Guest to Aggregus shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host and the Host will make the
    Experience available to Guest in the agreed upon manner as if the Host has received the Experience Fees. Each Host agrees that, Aggregus may (i) permit the
    Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Guest that portion of the Experience Fees specified in Aggregus’s cancellation policy. In accepting
    appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Aggregus assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host. Please note that Aggregus
    does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you acknowledge and agree that Aggregus reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
    to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings in accordance with the Modification Section of these Terms. Please note that
    Aggregus will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests</u>
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    The Hosts, not Aggregus, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Experiences reserved through the Services. If
    you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Experience, you agree and understand that you will be required to
    enter into an agreement (including releases) with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such
    Experience imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Aggregus, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such
    agreements, that Aggregus is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Aggregus disclaims all
    liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Aggregus is not a party to any
    agreements between you and the Host, Aggregus acts as the Host’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the
    Host. Upon your payment of amounts to Aggregus which are due to the Host, your payment obligation to the Host for such amounts is extinguished, and
    Aggregus is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Aggregus’s Host Fees, to the Host. In the event that Aggregus does not remit any such amounts to a
    Host, such Host will have recourse only against Aggregus.
</p>
<p>
    Listings for Experiences will specify the Total Fees. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking within the specified
    timeframe (which is generally within 24-48 hours of when the booking is requested, as determined by Aggregus in its sole discretion) or the requested
    booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Aggregus
    will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s credit
    card will be released, if applicable.
</p>
<p>
    You agree to pay Aggregus for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Aggregus Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by
    the applicable Host. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that
    Aggregus, on behalf of the Host, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or
    (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro
    or one British pound) to verify your credit card. Once Aggregus receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Aggregus will collect the
    Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Aggregus
    cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Aggregus’s collection of the Total Fees, and Aggregus disclaims all
    liability in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card
    information either to Aggregus or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Aggregus for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your
    Aggregus Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods as may be described on the Site or Application – e.g. by credit card. You hereby
    authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Aggregus or indirectly,
    via a third party online payment processor or by one of the other payment methods as may be described on the Site or Application. You also authorize
    Aggregus to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Experience as contemplated under “Damage to Experiences” below and for Security
    Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Aggregus’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that
    third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before
    using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.
</p>
<p>
    Security Deposits
</p>
<p>
    Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (“Security Deposits”). Each Listing will note if a Security Deposit is required for the
    applicable Experience, the amount of any such Security Deposit and whether such Security Deposit is non-refundable. If a Security Deposit is included in a
    Listing for a confirmed booking of Experience, Aggregus will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Host, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
    obtain a pre-authorization of the Guest’s credit card in the amount the Host determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the
    Guest’s check-in at the applicable Host’s Experience. Aggregus will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts’ requests and claims
    related to Security Deposits, but Aggregus is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and
    disclaims any and all liability in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    Service Fees
</p>
<p>
    In consideration for providing the Services, Aggregus collects service fees from Hosts and Guests (“Service Fees”). Service Fees are made up of two (2)
    components: (i) Guest Fees (determined as provided above) and (ii) a fee that is charged to the Host based upon a percentage of the amount of the
    Experience Fees (“Host Fees”). Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Host Fees. Host Fees are deducted from the Experience Fees
    before remitting the Experience Fees to the Host, within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Experience (however, please note that we will
    not be responsible for delays in remitting Experience Fees, which can vary based on the bank, currency, location, etc.). Guest Fees are, as noted above,
    included in the Total Fees. Balances will be remitted by Aggregus to Hosts via check, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via
    the Application. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.
</p>
<p>
    General Booking and Financial Terms
</p>
<p>
    <u>Guest Cancellations and Refunds</u>
</p>
<p>
    If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, Aggregus will cancel any pre-authorization to your
    credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time.
</p>
<p>
    You agree to pay Aggregus for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Aggregus Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by
    the applicable Host. Once your booking is confirmed by the applicable Host, your Experience is non-refundable, except as provided below. If, as a Guest,
    you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Services, the cancellation policy as provided below will apply to such cancellation. For each such
    policy, you will remain liable for the non-refundable Guest Fee and any non-refundable Security Deposit. By default, the Standard Cancellation Policy
    (described below) will apply to such cancellation. However, some unique Experiences require a higher level of protection due to the nature of the
    Experience and the expenses involved. The Strict Cancellation Policy (described below) will apply to such cancellation if the Host has noted in the
    relevant Listing that such policy applies. As a Host, you may only apply the Strict Cancellation Policy to a Listing if you obtain prior permission from
    Aggregus, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@aggregus.com">support@Aggregus.com</a>. Further details regarding refunds and cancellation policies
    are available via the Site and Application.
</p>
<p>
    Standard Cancellation Policy
</p>
<p>
    48 hours before scheduled start of Experience:
</p>
<p>
    If, as a Guest, you notify the Host of the cancellation more than 48 hours before the Experience begins, you will receive a 100% refund, minus taxes and
    fees.
</p>
<p>
    Less than 48 hours before scheduled start of Experience:
</p>
<p>
    If, as a Guest, you notify the Host of the cancellation less than 48 hours (but more than 24 hours) before the Experience begins, you will receive a 50%
    refund, minus taxes and fees.
</p>
<p>
    Less than 24 hours before scheduled start of Experience:
</p>
<p>
    If, as a Guest, you notify the Host of the cancellation less than 24 hours before the Experience begins, arrive more than 15 minutes late, or begin the
    Experience and decide to leave early, you will not receive a refund and the entire Experience cost is non-refundable.
</p>
<p>
    Strict Cancellation Policy
</p>
<p>
    30+ days before Experience: If, as a Guest, you notify the Host of the cancellation more than 30 days before the Experience, you will receive a 100%
    refund, minus taxes and fees. For clarity, such cancellations must be made 30 full days in advance (prior to 12:00 AM local time on the date the Experience
    is scheduled to begin).
</p>
<p>
    Less than 30 days before Experience: If, as a Guest, you notify the Host of the cancellation less than 30 days before the Experience begins, arrive more
    than 15 minutes late, or begin the Experience and decide to leave early, you will not receive a refund and the entire Experience cost is non-refundable.
</p>
<p>
    Unforeseen Circumstances
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of whether the Standard Cancellation Policy or Strict Cancellation Policy applies to the cancellation of a particular Experience, Aggregus
    retains sole discretion to make case-by-case cancellation decisions. If you are a Guest, please contact us immediately at support@Aggregus.com if
    unforeseen circumstances should arise that prevent you from taking the Experience (for example, a death in the Guest’s family or political unrest at the
    location of the Experience). If you are a Host, you hereby acknowledge that Aggregus retains sole discretion with respect to cancellation of Experiences.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Host Cancellations and Refunds</u>
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Services, (i) Aggregus will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a
    commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Guest may receive an email or other communication from Aggregus containing alternative
    Listings and other related information. If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative
    Listing confirms the Guest’s requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Aggregus the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Experience
    in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. For clarity, in the event the alternative Experience is of a higher price than the former, you
    may be responsible for any difference in price. In the event the alternative Experience is of a lower price, you may be entitled to a partial refund for
    the difference. If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Aggregus, please
    contact Aggregus at <a href="mailto:support@aggregus.com">support@Aggregus.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Cancellation in the Event of Inclement Weather</u>
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    Certain Experiences may be weather-dependent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of inclement weather, the Host has the discretion as to whether
    the weather conditions will prevent the Experience from taking place. As a Host, if you need to cancel an Experience for reasons of inclement weather, you
    must contact the Visitor and Aggregus (at <a href="mailto:support@aggregus.com">support@Aggregus.com</a>) as early as possible. Subject to the Guest’s
    consent, the Host and the Guest may choose to reschedule the Experience for another date.
</p>
<p>
    If the Experience cannot be rescheduled, as a Guest, please contact Aggregus so we may assist in finding a replacement, non-weather-dependent Experience.
    For clarity, in the event the alternative Experience is of a higher price than the former, you may be responsible for any difference in price. In the event
    the alternative Experience is of a lower price, you may be entitled to a partial refund for the difference.
</p>
<p>
    As a Guest, if you have contacted Aggregus as provided above and Aggregus is unable to find you a replacement Experience, Aggregus may refund the Total
    Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation.
</p>
<p>
    Taxes
</p>
<p>
    You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors.
    Aggregus cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Services. Additionally, please note that each Host is responsible for
    determining local indirect Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings.
</p>
<p>
    Damage
</p>
<p>
    As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the all personal, real or other property associated with an Experience (including equipment, vehicles, spaces
    and other property) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and
    omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who you invite to attend, participate in, or otherwise provide access to,
    the Experience. In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to, photographs, you agree to pay the
    cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will
    be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Aggregus Account. Aggregus also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your
    Aggregus Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Aggregus in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in
    situations in which you have been determined, in Aggregus’s sole discretion, to have damaged any Experience, including, but not limited to, in relation to
    any payments made by Aggregus to Hosts. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit
    payment for any damage to the Experience to the applicable Host or to Aggregus (if applicable).
</p>
<p>
    Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Aggregus in good faith, and to provide Aggregus with such information and take such actions as may
    be reasonably requested by Aggregus, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Experiences or any personal, real or other
    property associated with an Experience or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Aggregus or a representative of Aggregus regarding use or abuse
    of the Services. If you are a Guest, upon Aggregus’s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in
    mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Aggregus or a third party selected by Aggregus,
    with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from you.
</p>

    Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
</p>
<p>
    These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and the United States of America, without regard to its
    conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Olympia, Washington, for any actions for
    which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
    infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set
    forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.
</p>
<p>
    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration
</p>
<p>
    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
</p>
<p>
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at    <a href="mailto:support@aggregus.com">support@Aggregus.com</a>. In the unlikely event that our customer care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may
    have (or if Aggregus has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes
    through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and
    less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court
    can award. Aggregus will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the
    payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual
    basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration Agreement
</p>
<p>
    Aggregus and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but
    is not limited to:
</p>
<p>
    · claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any
    other legal theory;
</p>
<p>
    · claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
</p>
<p>
    · claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
</p>
<p>
    · claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
</p>
<p>
    References to “Aggregus”, “you”, and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and
    assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to
    the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows,
    seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Aggregus are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
    participate in a class action. These Terms evidence a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the
    interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
</p>
<p>
    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Aggregus
    should be addressed to 1711 Carolina St. #107, Bellingham, WA (“Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the
    claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Aggregus and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty
    (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Aggregus may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any
    settlement offer made by Aggregus or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or
    Aggregus is entitled.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA
    Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available
    online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these
    Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the
    arbitration provision. Unless Aggregus and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both
    parties with due consideration of their ability to travel nd other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
    determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on
    the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim
    exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
    shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Aggregus will pay all AAA
    filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the AAA Rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration in
    which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve
    disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days
    of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
    relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND AGGREGUS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
    CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Aggregus agree
    otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
    proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Aggregus makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a
    change to the Arbitration Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty
    (30) calendar days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate
    any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.

</p>
<p>
    General
</p>
<p>
    The failure of Aggregus to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The
    waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Aggregus. Except as expressly
    set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these
    Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that
    provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
